# Snake_Battle
- This is a two-player snake game. Both players need to control the snake to eat all the frogs. When a player eats all the 
frogs first, the player will win that round and they will enter the next level. Player who is too slow has no chance of 
survival. Try to become the biggest and fastest snake!

- It's made for final project of programming course.
